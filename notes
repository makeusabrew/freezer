Core assumptions

* a given URL is a unique sequence
* the contents of a given URL are expected to change over time
* the URL returns JSON

Rough schemas

** sequence
- id
- URL

** snapshot
- id
- sequence_id
- timestamp
- hash
- data (JSON)

Rough parts

** freezer
- serves up a given sequence of snapshots
- can be controlled in various ways
-> @TODO

** fetcher
- takes a full URL
- takes a fetch interval
- checks the URL until the contents of it change
- at which point it writes a new snapshot

Annotations
 - arbitrary notes on single, multiple or ranges of files

Notes
 - random notes against a sequence bound to time rather than a file (e.g. "spotted xxx") to allow further investigation

Summaries
 - range of files in sequential order representing a particular scenario
