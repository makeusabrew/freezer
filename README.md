## Freezer - serving ice-cold JSON, just how you like it

Freezer attempts to take the pain out of building apps which consume
fast-changing JSON endpoints over HTTP. It does this by saving a copy of a
feed each time it changes and giving you fine-grained control over replaying
those changes at when *you* want them to change. These changes can be initiated
manually or programatically to allow manual or automated testing against
traditionally hard to capture, hard to control and hard to replay data.
